* Jupyter Notebook [https://jupyter.org/install] (if you install Anaconda, this should come together)

With python installed, you can install the dependencies (not necessary if using Anaconda):

```sh
pip install numpy==1.16.4 statsmodels==0.10.0 pandas==0.25.1 matplotlib==3.1.0 scikit-learn==0.21.2
